# Mama Seeks
### *"there's something in the darkness..."*
Try to find your way out of a mansion in the middle of the night.
## Welcome!
### *"Where am I?"*
Congratulations! if you're reading this, you've found the Github repo For Mama Seeks, a 3D puzzle-horror game, made by Green Line Studios! Feel free to look through the code and see what we've updated!
## The Goal
### *"Why am I here?"*
Your goal is to find out what's going on in the mansion, and then get out as fast as possible. Of course, doing that isn't as simple as it sounds, thus the puzzle part of puzzle-horror.
## Development
### *"Where is everything?"*
the game will be updated as things are completed. we will, however, try our best to complete updates as fast as possible. We can't guarantee updates within a certain time frame, but we will try our best.
